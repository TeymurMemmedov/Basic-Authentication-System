## Description

This project is an ASP.NET Core application that showcases various features related to user authentication and validation using ASP.NET Core Identity. It provides a solid foundation for building secure web applications with features such as cookie-based authentication, user registration, email confirmation, password reset, and custom validations.

## Features

### 1. Cookie-based Authentication

- The project implements cookie-based authentication for secure user sessions.
- Users can log in and stay authenticated across multiple pages and sessions.

### 2. User Registration

- Users can create new accounts by providing a username, email, and password.
- User data is securely stored in the database using ASP.NET Core Identity.

### 3. Email Confirmation

- Upon registration, users receive an email confirmation link to verify their email addresses.
- Email confirmation is required for account activation and enhanced security.

### 4. Password Reset

- Users who forget their passwords can request a password reset.
- A secure password reset link is sent to the user's registered email address.

### 5. Custom Validations

- The project implements custom validation rules in addition to ASP.NET Core Identity's default validations.
- Custom validators ensure that user data meets specific requirements, such as password complexity and email uniqueness.
